= Generating chart image files using Pyret commandline

Install pyret-npm

  npm i -g pyret-npm

This provides the executable `pyret` which takes a Pyret file as
argument and runs it.

The file `pyret-chart-image-gen.arr` contains Pyret code that
reads a CSV table in file `Animals-Dataset-1.5.1.csv`, creates a
scatter plot, renders it as a image, and stores that image in
`animal-chart.png`. To run,

  pyret pyret-chart-image-gen.arr

and view the generated image file

  animal-chart.png
